# Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is a critical concept in distributed systems, especially in the context of blockchain technology. It addresses the challenges of achieving consensus in a network where some nodes may behave unpredictably or maliciously.

## 🧠 The BFT Problem

In a distributed network, not every participant can be trusted. Some may **fail, lie, or act maliciously**. This leads to the _Byzantine Fault Tolerance Problem_:

:::warning Problem
_If all the generals coordinate their attack and strike at the same time, the battle is won. However, if two generals falsely claim they will attack but instead retreat, the battle is lost. This failure in coordination undermines the entire strategy._

_- Leslie Lamport, Robert Shostak, and Marshall Pease (1982)_

### 🔁 Rotating Leaders

To reduce the risk of being stuck with a malicious leader:

1. The protocol uses **rotating leaders**.
2. Each round, a new node becomes the **leader**.
3. If one leader **misbehaves**, the system can recover in the **next round** under an honest leader.

But this only works well if each round **achieves consensus**, which brings us to the next point.

## 📢 Byzantine Broadcast

# FIXME

Properties:

1. **Termination:** Every honest node eventually decides on some output.
2. **Agreement:** All honest nodes decide on the same output.
3. **Validity:** If the sender is honest and sends a message, all honest nodes decide on that message.
```

### 🧪 Example 1: $f = 1$

Let $f = 1$ be the function. Let’s say:

- There are **4 nodes**, and $f = 1$ (one can be Byzantine).
- The **sender** sends a message to others.
- Each node **echoes** the message to everyone else.
- If a node sees **enough matching echoes**, it commits to the message.

This ensures that even if one node lies, the **majority truth** prevails.

### 🧪 Example 2: $f = 2$

Let $f = 2$ be the function. Let’s say:
