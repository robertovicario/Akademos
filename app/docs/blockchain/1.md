# Introduction

## 🔗 Blockchain

_Blockchain_ is a special kind of **database** that stores information in a **chain of blocks**. Each block contains a **list of transactions**, and these blocks are **linked together** in the order they were added like a **digital ledger**.

### 🌐 Decentralization

_Decentralization_ means that **control** and **decision-making** aren't held by a **single entity**, like a **company** or **government**. Instead, **power** is **distributed** across a **network** of **independent participants**.

### 🏛️ Centralized vs Decentralized

| Feature | Centralized System | Decentralized System |
|-|-|-|
| Control | One authority | Shared among network participants |
| Risk of failure | Single point of failure | Highly resilient |
| Censorship | Possible | Very hard to enforce |
| Transparency | Limited or none | Often fully open |
| Speed | Usually faster | Sometimes slower |

## 🧠 The Consensus Problem

In decentralized systems, no single person or computer is in charge, so how do all the independent nodes agree on **what’s true**? That’s the _Consensus Problem_:

:::warning Problem
_How can a group of participants, who don't fully trust each other, agree on a single version of the truth?_
