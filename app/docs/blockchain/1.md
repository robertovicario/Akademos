## ⛓️ Blockchain

_Blockchain_ is a special kind of **database** that stores information in a **chain of blocks**. Each block contains a **list of transactions**, and these blocks are **linked together** in the order they were added like a **digital ledger**.

### ⚙️ Working

- Transactions
- Blocks
- Chain

...

:::info Mining
The process of creating a new block and adding it to the blockchain is called **mining**. In a real-world blockchain, this process involves solving complex **mathematical problems** to validate transactions and secure the network.
:::

:::info Genesis Block
The **genesis block** is the first block in a blockchain and serves as the foundation of the chain. It is **unique** because it has no previous block, and its `previous_hash` is set to `0`. This block is crucial for establishing the **integrity** and **immutability** of the blockchain.

### 🌐 Decentralization

_Decentralization_ means that **control** and **decision-making** aren't held by a **single entity**, like a **company** or **government**. Instead, **power** is **distributed** across a **network** of **independent participants**.

### 🏛️ Centralized vs Decentralized

| Feature | Centralized System | Decentralized System |
|-|-|-|
| Control | One authority | Shared among network participants |
| Risk of failure | Single point of failure | Highly resilient |
| Censorship | Possible | Very hard to enforce |
| Transparency | Limited or none | Often fully open |
| Speed | Usually faster | Sometimes slower |

### 🚀 Playground

You can play by creating a sample blockchain using my [Playground](/blog/blockchain-1).

## 🧠 The Consensus Problem

In decentralized systems, no single person or computer is in charge, so how do all the independent nodes agree on **what’s true**? That’s the _Consensus Problem_:

:::warning Problem
_How can a group of participants, who don't fully trust each other, agree on a single version of the truth?_
